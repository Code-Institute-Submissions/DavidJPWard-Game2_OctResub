EXISTING FEATURES

-Team selector

you may select your team from the pool of monsters in the select team tab, you can have a maximum
or 6 monsters on a team, with any number of duplicates so if you have a favourite monster, pick 6
of them. you can see your current team on the main page, so you can double check before entering

-Fighting

with a team selected you may eneter battle. to fight, pick a move, then the speed is calculated 
to decide which monster goes first, they then attack, if the other monster is still kicking, they
then move, and the game checks if the first monster is alive, this carrys on til one faints and
is replaced with another monster is one is availble, if not the game is over and the player with 
members left wins.

-score tracker

TESTING

i have been testing solely with player testing, if i find and error, i locate it and fix it.
saying this, there has been alot of bugs, mainly logical errors which have been tricky to track down
but very simple to fix. there are still a few logical errors, you can input moves while your monster
is fainted which is not ideal, and on occasion is a monsters health drops below 0 they do not faint.
